### Tableau Refresh Extract (Externally)


TRExt is a means to refresh a Tableau Extract (.tde files) externally so the Tableau Server can 
serve visual content without having to compete for resources while refreshing extracts internally.

The dependencies are:

- [TableauSDK](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/api/sdk/en-us/SDK/tableau_sdk_installing.htm)
- pyodbc
