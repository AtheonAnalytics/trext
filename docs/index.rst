-------------------------------

TRExt is short for Tableau Refresh Extract (Externally).

TRExt provides an API to create a .tde extract from a database and publish to a Tableau Server,
and this does not need the Tableau Desktop to set up.

This documentation contains instructions on how to best use TRExt with your database, as well as
the API documentation if you want to get into the details.

The repository is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/AtheonAnalytics/trext>`_ if you wish
to fork, contribute or just install and play around.
